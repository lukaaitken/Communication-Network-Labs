Video Streaming
==============
In this lab you will implement a streaming video server and client that communicate using the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and send data using the Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP). Your task is to implement the RTSP protocol in the client and implement the RTP packetization in the server. We will provide you code that implements the RTSP protocol in the server, the RTP de-packetization in
the client, and takes care of displaying the transmitted video.
